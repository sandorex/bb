# bb
bb is a cross-platform utility based on [ebd](https://github.com/sandorex/ebd) to access browser bookmarks from commandline

### Compared to other cli bookmarks utilities
bb differs by using the browser bookmark database directly, so you will be able to access bookmarks added via terminal on the browser and vice versa
